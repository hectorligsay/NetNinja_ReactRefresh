Multiple Components

App.js is the first component for the app and its the root component.
This sits on top of the tree.
Making more components will be nested in this one
* Navbar
* blog 
* sidebar

Basically a component tree

Create in src folder and export it

Import it in your root (app.js) and then put it into the file

Create component for the homepage content:
do the same process
