Components and Templates:
Each component is a self contained section of content 
* nav bar
* article
* sidebar


Components contain:
* Templates
* Logic

jsx: Allows to easily create html styles and components. Babel creates these templates and 
to the dom.

jsx vs html:
* jsx uses camelcase for className vs html is just class

older versions of react (17 and older): you need to import React from 'react'

For this part we remove most of the template stuff we don't need 

We always export the component so we can use it elsewhere
