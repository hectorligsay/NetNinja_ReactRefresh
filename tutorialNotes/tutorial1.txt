What is react?
Js library to create interactive websites and interfaces : SPA (single page application)
* init request to server then react takes over and manages whole website in the browser including any website data or click events or routing 
from page to page 

* React changes all content in the browser 
* New pages are loaded in fairly quickly using these routes 
* Traditional websites : every link sends request to server for new html page
